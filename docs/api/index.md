# API Reference

This section documents the public Python API exposed by FluxQueue.  
It focuses on what is available (classes, methods, environment variables), not on step-by-step usage.

If you are looking for how to install and use FluxQueue in a project, start with the
[Installation](../tutorial/installation.md) and [Quick Start](../tutorial/quickstart.md) guides instead.
